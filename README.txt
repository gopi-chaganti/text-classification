Explored the utility of different learning algorithms for a text classification task

Tried various configurations to process and represent data.

Data representaion: Unigrams, Bigrams
Preprocessing : converted all words to lower case,filterd out stop words, applied stemming using nltk library
Feature Representation: CountVectorizer, TFIDVectorizer
Feature Selection : L1,L2
Hyperparameters : tweaked hyperparameters specific to each classification algorithm
